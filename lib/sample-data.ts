Does Reading secretly have the best banana pudding in the UK? 👀

Pulled up to Bubba Bloom to find out… and honestly, I wasn't ready.

🔥 The corn dogs – dangerous levels of cheese pull.
🍓 Strawberry Matcha – earthy, sweet, addictive.
⚡️ Red Bull Mocktail – if you love Red Bull, this is a problem.
🧋 Brown Sugar Bubble Tea – my go-to, full flavour, no misses.
🍌 Banana Pudding – hands down one of the BEST.

Everything hit, everything delivered, and everything went down way too easily.

If you're in Reading, this is a MUST.

BBQ heaven. This is what I came for.
