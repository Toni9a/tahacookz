Well presented, good variety and a great way to try a few things at once. Loved every item on the board \u00e2\u0080\u0093 flavoursome, balanced and very moreish.\n\nFor mains:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Mixed Grill \u00e2\u0080\u0093 generous portion and rich in flavour. Lamb chops and prawns were the best components and cooked properly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Chicken Bang Bang Noodles \u00e2\u0080\u0093 coated in a sweet-spicy glaze with pepper, onion and lime. Big flavour, slightly sticky and very enjoyable.\n\nFor sides:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Loaded Chips \u00e2\u0080\u0093 cheesy, saucy and with their dynamite blend. Ideal table sharer.\n\nTo drink:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Strawberry Daiquiri \u00e2\u0080\u0093 fresh, fruity and not overly sweet.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Cherry Pynk \u00e2\u0080\u0093 citrusy, sparkling and light.\n\nFor dessert:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Bread & Butter Pudding \u00e2\u0080\u0093 warm, indulgent and great with custard and rice sauce. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Brownie \u00e2\u0080\u0093 classic, rich and works well with vanilla ice cream.\n\nOverall: well presented, bold flavours and a menu built around sharing and indulgence. The noodles and sliders were the highlights for me and would order again.",

The beef patties had that proper crust, the buns were soft and buttery, and every bite hit differently.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5 The Buffalo Buttermelt stood out - crispy buttermilk chicken coated in buffalo sauce with herby ranch and chives. Unreal combo.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0097 Went all in on the chicken strips - truffle, buffalo, BBQ and buttermelt. Each flavour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distinct, freshly fried, and actually juicy inside.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u009f Truffle Parmesan fries and Cheesy fries were both addictive, rich and indulgent.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u00a7\u0080 Habanero cheese bites and Mac n\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cheese bites were melty, spicy, proper comfort food.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u0097 House slaw balanced everything with that creamy tang.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u00ab Dessert? The Gooey chocolate brownie with ice cream finished things off strong - rich, fudgy, and the perfect ending.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00a4 Blueberry Red Bull Mocktail was a winner - fresh, fizzy and refreshing after all that richness.\n\nEverything looked premium, tasted fresh, and the menu has serious variety. Bur&Gur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really setting a standard for smash burgers and fried chicken in Southall.\n\n[invite]\n\n[halal food, southall food, halal burgers, smash burgers, hidden gem, Southall food, dark kitchen, truffle fries, comfort food, foodie uk, halal spots, viral food, mocktail bar, hidden gem, fried chicken, burger joint, cheese bites, dessert lovers, brownie and ice cream, halal uk, street food uk, food review, must try, diningwithtaha, halal eats, burger lovers, new spot alert, flavour packed, indulgent eats]",

The patties had a perfect crust, while the smoky sauce and chillies added a spicy kick that worked beautifully with the rich, juicy beef.\n\nDirty Fries\nCrispy fries topped with house-made coffee BBQ sauce, melted cheese, and pickled chillies. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re smoky, cheesy, and tangy\u00e2\u0080\u0094a side dish that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far too easy to devour.\n\nHoly Smokes BBQ delivers an authentic barbecue experience with dishes bursting with flavour, tender meats, and indulgent toppings.

They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got heat levels that go right up to \u00e2\u0080\u009cClucking\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and trust me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as hot as it sounds. The menu is packed with choices: tenders with toast, Nashville burgers, loaded fries, and even loaded Nashville mac and cheese, which is a dream come true. Mac and cheese is one of my favourites, so having it mixed with that proper Nashville kick made it a totally new experience.\n\nThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve thought of everything here, from Nashville-style mozzarella sticks and onion rings to churros with chocolate sauce to finish things off. And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling out more desserts next week, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll definitely be back to check those out.\n\nThe seasoning and flavour are just banging \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you get that proper spicy, smoky taste with every bite. And their sauces aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just some off-the-shelf stuff; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re made fresh and it shows. The peri-peri, honey mustard, hot honey, and their special sauce were all brilliant, each with its own flavour, and they paired perfectly with everything. The hot cheese pot was another winner; dunking the Nashville burger in it just added this mad cheesy layer, and the coleslaw was spot on too.\n\nThe place itself has got a nice, contemporary vibe with plenty of space to sit down and enjoy. The staff were proper friendly and helpful, which made the whole experience even better.\n\nHonestly, Hot Birdies is well worth the trip \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d drive two hours again just for another go. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re after some serious Nashville flavours, this place is the real deal.",

Every single option on the menu was top tier! \n\nThe TT Smash was an absolute hit, featuring pickled onions that added a perfect tang to the juicy, high-quality meat. Criminal Damage brought a sweet barbecue twist with caramelized onions and pickled chilies that worked brilliantly, while the Plain Jane won me over with its simplicity\u00e2\u0080\u0094it allowed the quality of the meat and the homemade special sauce to shine.

It was served with prawn cocktail crisps that elevated the dish to a new level. The warm garlic butter brioche bun, paired with the cool imitation lobster mix and the crunch of prawn cocktail crisps, was simply outstanding. The flavours were unlike anything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever experienced. Even though I was stuffed, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop myself from finishing the roll\u00e2\u0080\u0094it spoke to me on a different level! \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u00a4\u00f0\u009f\u00a6\u009e \n\nShout out to Sameer, the chef and true genius behind it all.

The vibe inside is laid-back and casual, making it perfect for a quick bite with friends or family.\n\nI tried a few different things, starting with the smash burger and the fried chicken & smash combo burger. Both were solid\u00e2\u0080\u0094flavourful, juicy, and with a good mix of toppings. The only thing that could make them better is if the meat quality was a notch higher, but for the price, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re definitely hitting the mark.\n\nThe smash croissant was something new, but it was a bit on the dry side. I like the idea behind it, though, and with a little extra sauce, it could be a winner.\n\nNow, the loaded fries were fantastic! I had the chicken-loaded fries and the brisket-loaded fries, and both were loaded with flavour. The fries stayed crispy under all the toppings, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always easy to pull off, so that was impressive.\n\nBut the stars of the show were definitely the wings and tenders. The Korean wings were crispy with just the right amount of heat and sweetness, and the mango habanero wings packed a punch without being too overpowering. The hickory barbecue tenders were tender (as they should be!) and coated in a smoky, tangy sauce that was spot-on.\n\nThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also got a good variety of fizzy drinks, which were nice and refreshing alongside the heavier food.\n\nOverall, Smash Bites offers great value for money, especially if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of wings, tenders, or loaded fries. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room to fine-tune a couple of items like the smash croissant, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a spot I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the mood for some tasty fast food with a twist.\n\n[halal, halal food London, foodie, review, invite, food, halal food, halal dining, East London Food, halal dining, must-try, hidden gem, local favourite, smash burgers, chicken burger, wings]",

The September special, the Buffalo Blaze Sando, featured a fried chicken fillet drenched in tangy buffalo sauce, topped with crispy fried onions, American cheese, and house sauce, all nestled in a soft brioche bun. This was a standout \u00e2\u0080\u0093 spicy, saucy, crunchy, and absolutely delicious. The Frickles (battered and fried pickles) served with ranch sauce were the perfect complement, adding a crispy and tangy bite.\n\nThe October special didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappoint either. The Chili Cheese Dog, a twist on the classic hotdog, was nostalgic yet elevated with homemade chili that took it to another level. The Butter Chicken Empanadas were a unique and flavourful spin on the Mexican classic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 truly delightful.\n\nAmong the core menu items, the Bengal Blaze Burger with its Naga sauce was a spicy yet well-balanced masterpiece, while the Big Bunz Smash Burger, with caramelized onions and lamb bacon, offered a deep, rich flavour profile. The wings and tenders were some of the best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had, with the Dynamite and Honey & Garlic flavors being personal favourites. The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the mozzarella sticks were another hit.\n\nFor drinks, the mocktails were refreshing, but the Brown Sugar Bubble Tea was the real standout\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of the best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had. Bunz MK also offers a great range of boycott-friendly drink options, which is a nice touch for those mindful of their choices. The homemade tiramisu and Lotus Dream Cake, were the perfect sweet finish.\n\nBunz MK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variety, monthly specials, and excellent service make it a must-visit. The staff were friendly, and the clean, modern store created a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience. An absolute must visit! \n\n@jabranding_ \u00e2\u009c\u008d\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bc \n\n#miltonkeynes #halalfood #halalfoodlondon #americanfood #octoberspecial",

The food was unbelievable, especially considering the price point. \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008a\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bc\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00b0 \n\nThe smash burgers were top-notch, with a perfect crust on the patties. The wings were delightfully crunchy and crispy, and the dynamite flavour had a nice kick. The loaded fries, topped with fried chicken, were cheesy, saucy, and paired perfectly with the burgers. \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0094\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u009f \n\nThe McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-style crispy chicken burger and Big Mac were also great options. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re craving something similar to McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but prefer a more ethical, halal option, Zee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s has got you covered. The slush was surprisingly good \u00e2\u0080\u0094 high-quality and not artificial tasting. The milk cake, which is my personal weakness, was also amazing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 creamy, milky, sweet, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00a4\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u00b0 \n\nWhether you want a quick meal or a feast with friends or family, Zee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offers affordable, high-quality, fresh food that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoroughly enjoyable. \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Zee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in Wembley or coming from further away\u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely worth the visit! \n\n#halalfoodlondon #halalfood #halalfoodie #smashburgers #musttry #hiddengem \n\n[halal, halal food London, foodie, review, invite, food, halal food, halal dining, East London Food, halal dining, must-try, hidden gem, local favourite, Wembley food, Halal McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, smash burgers, chicken burger, halal food Wembley, loaded fries, chicken wings]",

The smash burgers were a hit with their perfectly crispy crust. There were plenty of options for toppings and sauces, allowing for a customizable and enjoyable burger experience. However, the burgers could benefit from just a touch more sauce to enhance their flavour further.\n\nThe loaded fries were a highlight, offering a generous portion with the right balance of toppings. Additionally, the milkshakes were thick and creamy, making them a perfect pairing with the meal and a great way to round out the meal. \n\nOverall, Smash Shack is a fantastic spot for burger lovers, a must visit for all those in Watford! \n\n#halalfoodwatford #halalfoodie #smashburgers #loadedfries #musttry #hiddengem #watford #halalfood #musthave",

From the moment you step in, the elegant and classy decor immediately stands out, creating a sophisticated yet welcoming atmosphere. The ambience is perfect for a meal with friends or family, offering a chic and comfortable dining experience. \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00ab\n\nThe food at Namkeen is exceptional, easily rivaling renowned establishments like Watan and Dawat, and in some cases, surpassing them. The starters are a delightful introduction to the meal, with the grilled dishes being a massive hit. Each item is seasoned and cooked to perfection, showcasing a mastery of flavour and technique. The papri chaat strikes a perfect balance of creamy and tangy, setting the tone for the rest of the meal. \u00f0\u009f\u008c\u00b6\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\n\nAmong the standout dishes, the chapli kebab deserves special mention. It boasts a perfect golden crust with a tender, flavourful interior that is simply unbelievable. The keema naan is another highlight, impressively delicious and a must-try. However, the samosas were a slight letdown as they had been precooked and reheated, lacking the freshness found in the other dishes.\n\nThe drinks at Namkeen are exceptional, with the strawberry mint mojito standing out as particularly refreshing, with just the right amount of sweetness. The main courses do not disappoint either. The lamb charski karahi and chicken karahi are both top-tier dishes, perfectly paired with freshly made naan. The Afghani pulao is also a standout, executed to perfection. \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a9\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\n\nThe nihari is another stand out dish, featuring a perfectly slow-cooked lamb shank in a spicy, flavourful gravy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arguably one of the best nihari dishes you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find. \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008f\n\nNamkeen is a fantastic addition to Tooting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dining options, offering a superb culinary experience in a beautiful setting. Despite being a new entrant, it is poised to compete with the best restaurants in town. Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning a meal with friends or family, Namkeen promises an unforgettable dining experience. \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\n\n#tootingbroadway #halalfoodlondon #afghanifood #pakistanifood #halalfood #musttry",

I had the pleasure of trying the best selling menu items. \n\nThe chicken shawarma stole the show with its delectable blend of flavors. The falafel wrap and Arayes showcased authentic Lebanese goodness. While the loaded chicken shawarma fries had massive potential, the letdown was the stale fries. Despite this hiccup, the overall quality and variety of dishes make it a commendable spot for a quick, satisfying bite in Camden. A flavourful recommendation for those exploring the area!\n\n[halal, halal food London, foodie, review, invite, food, halal food, halal dining, Camden food spots, Lebanese cuisine, halal dining, must-try, hidden gem, local favourite, vibrant, atmosphere, experience, Lebanese food, food spot, hummus, Beirut, mutabbal, baba ghanoush, tasty, exquisite, savoury]",

The chicken fillet was thick and breaded nicely, crunchy on the outside and tender to the bite, along with the toppings that were paired perfectly! The smash burgers although had good flavour, unfortunately were dry and the meat lacked quality - I had visited a few months prior to their official lunch and the smash burgers were juicy and had a great crust, so hopefully this is a quick fix and will take @sidestreetofficial to another level! \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0094\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0094\n\nTenders & Wings: these were delightful - fried to perfection and all of the different flavours were on point! Excellently executed and thoroughly enjoyed! \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0097\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\n\nLoaded Fries: Wow! These were incredible- both the Philly cheese steak loaded fries and the chicken loaded fries hit the spot. A perfect mix of flavours, the loaded fries are one of the highlights of the menu! \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u009f\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\n\nDrinks: a good variety of drinks, tasty but a few weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very fizzy- again, this should be a quick fix! \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00a4\u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00a4\n\nOverall, this will be my go to spot in Reading for sure- I would highly recommend @sidestreetofficial and would suggest everyone to visit the Reading branch on Saturday, as @sidestreetofficial will have a 50% off launch offer! \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a9\u00f0\u009f\u008c\u009f\n\n#halalfood #halalfoodreading #foodblogger #burgers #openingday #deliciousfood",

The array of desserts are incredible- the cakes I had were of the highest quality and I thoroughly enjoyed them. \n\nI had a very pleasant experience and I will be back with friends and family time and time again! \n\n#hiddengem #uxbridge #halalfoodlondon #persianfood #turkishfood #desserts #cakes #halalrestaurant",

The sesame brioche bun kept the burger together, the sauce was the right amount, balanced in taste and the toppings complemented the burger really well. \n\nThe Good Burger was in fact very good! 2 perfectly smashed beef patties, paired with their in house burger sauce and the same toppings as the 4x4 burger. If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle 4 patties, then this is for you! \n\nThe Danny Dorito burger was a nice surprise! I have had burgers with tortilla chips in them, but too often they are stale and bland. This was not the case here - fresh chilli heatwave Doritos are crushed and top two smashed beef patties, alongside chopped turkey bacon, giving the burger an extra crunch and enhancing the flavour profile of this fantastic burger. \n\nThe Eggslut burger worked really well- usually you may find a runny fried egg on a thick, large beef patty, however, the fried egg went really well with the smashed patties, and once again, the chopped turkey bacon made for a delicious burger. If you like a fried egg on your large, thick burgers, then this is a must try. \n\nSee pinned comment for the rest of the review! \n\n#theburgerfirm #smashburgers #friedchicken #halalfoodlondon #burgerjoint #milkshake #invite",

This was a very solid bagel, bursting with flavour and so saucy! The chicken was fresh, the fried plantain complimented the bagel really well, the avocado was a good addition, but could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done with being more ripe. Topped with jerk sauce, cheese and finally some hot Nando\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sauce, the bagel really was filling and packed with flavour! A tasty bagel, perfect for a quick lunch or post work bite. \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00af\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0097 \n\nMixed slush - Wow! This slush is quite easily the best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had! The combination of flavours worked so so well, and there was no hint of a strange after taste as there is with most slushes! The delicious flavours remained right through to the last drop, a rarity with slushes! \u00f0\u009f\u008d\u00b9\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\n\nOverall, I had a great experience @dabagelspot - the bagel and slush were brilliant, and the service was fantastic.  The other menu items look incredible and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure to be back when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m next In Shoreditch! An affordable and delicious spot for all to enjoy! \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008c\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bc\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\n\n#dabagelspot #shoreditch #jerkchicken #slush #jamaicanfood",
