Well presented, good variety and a great way to try a few things at once. Loved every item on the board â flavoursome, balanced and very moreish.\n\nFor mains:\nâ¢ Mixed Grill â generous portion and rich in flavour. Lamb chops and prawns were the best components and cooked properly.\nâ¢ Chicken Bang Bang Noodles â coated in a sweet-spicy glaze with pepper, onion and lime. Big flavour, slightly sticky and very enjoyable.\n\nFor sides:\nâ¢ Loaded Chips â cheesy, saucy and with their dynamite blend. Ideal table sharer.\n\nTo drink:\nâ¢ Strawberry Daiquiri â fresh, fruity and not overly sweet.\nâ¢ Cherry Pynk â citrusy, sparkling and light.\n\nFor dessert:\nâ¢ Bread & Butter Pudding â warm, indulgent and great with custard and rice sauce. \nâ¢ Brownie â classic, rich and works well with vanilla ice cream.\n\nOverall: well presented, bold flavours and a menu built around sharing and indulgence. The noodles and sliders were the highlights for me and would order again.",

From bold, aromatic spices to smoky, chargrilled meats, every bite takes you straight to the streets of Kabul. I had an amazing time trying out some proper classics, and I can highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for authentic flavours.\n\nHereâs what I tried:\n\nð Afghani Burger â This was something special. A proper street-food-style burger loaded with spiced sausages and meatloaf, fries, and a flavour-packed sauce wrapped in soft naan bread. It had that perfect balance of heat, smokiness, and crunch. So good, I had to go back for it again!\n\nð¥ Lamb Manto â These steamed dumplings were packed with seasoned minced meat, topped with a rich tomato-based sauce and a cooling yoghurt drizzle. Every bite was juicy, savoury, and comfortingâproper Afghani flavours done right.\n\nð¥© Chapli Kebab â A real Afghani classic. The minced meat was full of spices, perfectly crisp on the outside, yet soft and tender inside. Paired with chutneys and fresh naan, this was a proper winner.\n\nð¦ Icecream â This was unreal. Creamy, and bursting with unique flavours, this went down a treat. If you love rich, traditional desserts, this is a must-try!\n\nð¥ Kabuli Pulao (Sold Out ð) â This is one of my favourite dishes, and I was gutted to miss out on it! A fragrant rice dish cooked with lamb, carrots, and raisinsâitâs a true Afghani staple. Seeing how good the rest of the food was, I can only imagine how next-level this must be.\n\nð Final Thoughts? I enjoyed it so much that I had to visit again just for the Afghani burger and ice cream! The food is authentic, flavourful, and made with love. If youâre in the mood for bold spices, juicy kebabs, and proper Afghani street food, Kabul Corner is a MUST.\n\nð Location: Kabul Corner, Harrow \nâ Authentic Afghani flavours\nð¯ Highly recommended\n\nTag your foodie crew & pull up! ðð¥©ð¥\n\n#KabulCorner #AfghaniFood #StreetFoodLovers #FlavoursOfKabul #FoodieFinds",

SALTS Smokehouse is a smokehouse that takes things seriously, serving up low and slow-smoked brisket, fall-off-the-bone ribs, and juicy smash burgers packed with deep, smoky flavour. You can taste the effort they put into every dish.\n\nI went in fully to see what the hype was about. Hereâs what I tried:\n\nð¥© Brisket â Smoked to perfection, melting in your mouth with every bite. The bark had that deep smoky hit, while the inside was tender, juicy, and full of flavour.\n\nð Short Ribs & Lamb Ribs â The short ribs were ridiculously softâliterally fell apart when I picked them up. The lamb ribs had that rich, meaty taste, with a perfect balance of fat and smokiness.\n\nð Smash Burger â You donât always expect a smokehouse to get smash burgers this right, but SALTS Smokehouse pulled it off. The edges were crisp, the centre was juicy, and it had that perfect smoky crust.\n\nð Wings â Some of the best wings Iâve had in a while. SALTS goes all in with unique flavours, and they donât hold back.\n\nð§ Mac & Cheese â Creamy, cheesy, pure comfort food\nð  Sweet Potato Fries â Crisp on the outside, fluffy inside\n\nð¥¤ Milkshakes â Thick, creamy, and a proper finisher after all that smoked goodness.\n\nð¥ Final Verdict? If you love proper smoked meats and big, bold flavours, SALTS is the place to be. From the brisket and ribs to the crazy wing flavours and smash burgers, everything is packed with serious flavour.

The tender, smoky brisket paired with perfectly seasoned fries made for a standout dish that Iâd highly recommend.\n\nThe Spicy Dip Chicken Burger was another highlightâManchester-style spicy dipped chicken, full of flavour with a crispy coating and a fiery kick. Itâs easily one of the best spicy dip burgers Iâve had down south, with just the right balance of spice.\n\nThe Classic Smash Burger was solid in flavour, but unfortunately, the temperature let it down slightly, drying out a bit by the time I got to it. Even so, it was still a tasty bite, and the overall quality of the beef smash patty was clear.\n\nIâm excited to see what they bring with their new menu in the new year!

This spot has quickly become one of my favourite meals of the year, thanks to its bold Korean fusion and attention to detail in every dish.\n\nThe menu features carefully curated options that focus on freshness and quality ingredients, ensuring every bite is packed with flavour. I had the pleasure of trying several dishes, and each one was outstanding, but the beef brisket deserves a special mention as the standout meat choiceâperfectly tender and rich in taste.\n\nFor those looking to try a bit of everything, Iâd specifically recommend Meal Deal 4 as the perfect munch box for one. Itâs ideal for satisfying your cravings, offering a mix of cheeky kimchi fries, buffalo wings, a bao bun of your choice, a mini corn dog, and a drink. This combo gives you a taste of the best Bibimbop has to offer, all in one satisfying box.\n\nSpeaking of the corn dog, it was an absolute delight! Crispy on the outside, wonderfully cheesy on the inside, and with a satisfying cheese pull that made it a real standout. Itâs a must-try for anyone who loves a perfect combination of crunch and gooey cheese.\n\nThe Bibimbap bowls, with their vibrant mix of fresh vegetables, sauces, and protein options, are another must-try. Pair them with sides like Kimchi Fries, topped with spicy mayo and Korean chilli flakes, or Buffalo Wings, which are bursting with Korean-inspired flavours. The Double Bao Buns were equally impressive, offering soft, fluffy buns with juicy fillings.\n\nWhether youâre a fan of traditional Korean dishes or looking for a creative fusion twist, Bibimbop excels in both areas. The flavours, quality, and execution make it a place I highly recommend. Donât miss out on the brisket and the corn dogâtheyâre game-changers!",

Criminal Damage brought a sweet barbecue twist with caramelized onions and pickled chilies that worked brilliantly, while the Plain Jane won me over with its simplicityâit allowed the quality of the meat and the homemade special sauce to shine.

The vibe inside is laid-back and casual, making it perfect for a quick bite with friends or family.\n\nI tried a few different things, starting with the smash burger and the fried chicken & smash combo burger. Both were solidâflavourful, juicy, and with a good mix of toppings. The only thing that could make them better is if the meat quality was a notch higher, but for the price, theyâre definitely hitting the mark.\n\nThe smash croissant was something new, but it was a bit on the dry side. I like the idea behind it, though, and with a little extra sauce, it could be a winner.\n\nNow, the loaded fries were fantastic! I had the chicken-loaded fries and the brisket-loaded fries, and both were loaded with flavour. The fries stayed crispy under all the toppings, which isnât always easy to pull off, so that was impressive.\n\nBut the stars of the show were definitely the wings and tenders. The Korean wings were crispy with just the right amount of heat and sweetness, and the mango habanero wings packed a punch without being too overpowering. The hickory barbecue tenders were tender (as they should be!) and coated in a smoky, tangy sauce that was spot-on.\n\nTheyâve also got a good variety of fizzy drinks, which were nice and refreshing alongside the heavier food.\n\nOverall, Smash Bites offers great value for money, especially if youâre a fan of wings, tenders, or loaded fries. Thereâs room to fine-tune a couple of items like the smash croissant, but itâs definitely a spot Iâd recommend if youâre in the mood for some tasty fast food with a twist.\n\n[halal, halal food London, foodie, review, invite, food, halal food, halal dining, East London Food, halal dining, must-try, hidden gem, local favourite, smash burgers, chicken burger, wings]",

The masala chips were perfectly spiced with a delightful fluffy interior, while the dynamite shrimp offered a balance of heat and sweetness with a satisfying crispy coating.\n\nFor the mains, I opted for two different noodle dishes, both of which were exceptional. The noodles were perfectly cooked, with vibrant, well-balanced sauces that packed a punch in flavor without overwhelming the palate. Each bite was a testament to the restaurantâs commitment to delivering quality pan-Asian cuisine.\n\nTo finish off the meal, the desserts provided a sweet and satisfying conclusion. While they may not have been the highlight of the evening, they were solid options to round off the overall dining experience on a pleasant note.\n\nOverall, @oodlesnoodlesldn has easily earned a place on my list of go-to restaurants. Itâs a place I will definitely return to with my family, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-tier pan-Asian dining experience.\n\n[Halal food London, halal gem, must-try, hidden gem, Pan-Asian cuisine, chic interiors, modern dining, family-friendly restaurant, noodle dishes, masala chips, dynamite shrimp, refreshing drinks, delicious starters, foodie favourites, dessert lovers, food recommendations, must-visit restaurant, culinary experience, Asian fusion, dining with friends, stylish restaurant, flavour]",

The September special, the Buffalo Blaze Sando, featured a fried chicken fillet drenched in tangy buffalo sauce, topped with crispy fried onions, American cheese, and house sauce, all nestled in a soft brioche bun. This was a standout â spicy, saucy, crunchy, and absolutely delicious. The Frickles (battered and fried pickles) served with ranch sauce were the perfect complement, adding a crispy and tangy bite.\n\nThe October special didnât disappoint either. The Chili Cheese Dog, a twist on the classic hotdog, was nostalgic yet elevated with homemade chili that took it to another level. The Butter Chicken Empanadas were a unique and flavourful spin on the Mexican classic â truly delightful.\n\nAmong the core menu items, the Bengal Blaze Burger with its Naga sauce was a spicy yet well-balanced masterpiece, while the Big Bunz Smash Burger, with caramelized onions and lamb bacon, offered a deep, rich flavour profile. The wings and tenders were some of the best Iâve had, with the Dynamite and Honey & Garlic flavors being personal favourites. The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the mozzarella sticks were another hit.\n\nFor drinks, the mocktails were refreshing, but the Brown Sugar Bubble Tea was the real standoutâone of the best Iâve had. Bunz MK also offers a great range of boycott-friendly drink options, which is a nice touch for those mindful of their choices. The homemade tiramisu and Lotus Dream Cake, were the perfect sweet finish.\n\nBunz MKâs variety, monthly specials, and excellent service make it a must-visit. The staff were friendly, and the clean, modern store created a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience.

The sesame brioche bun kept the burger together, the sauce was the right amount, balanced in taste and the toppings complemented the burger really well. \n\nThe Good Burger was in fact very good! 2 perfectly smashed beef patties, paired with their in house burger sauce and the same toppings as the 4x4 burger. If you canât handle 4 patties, then this is for you! \n\nThe Danny Dorito burger was a nice surprise! I have had burgers with tortilla chips in them, but too often they are stale and bland. This was not the case here - fresh chilli heatwave Doritos are crushed and top two smashed beef patties, alongside chopped turkey bacon, giving the burger an extra crunch and enhancing the flavour profile of this fantastic burger. \n\nThe Eggslut burger worked really well- usually you may find a runny fried egg on a thick, large beef patty, however, the fried egg went really well with the smashed patties, and once again, the chopped turkey bacon made for a delicious burger. If you like a fried egg on your large, thick burgers, then this is a must try. \n\nSee pinned comment for the rest of the review! \n\n#theburgerfirm #smashburgers #friedchicken #halalfoodlondon #burgerjoint #milkshake #invite",

This was a very solid bagel, bursting with flavour and so saucy! The chicken was fresh, the fried plantain complimented the bagel really well, the avocado was a good addition, but couldâve done with being more ripe. Topped with jerk sauce, cheese and finally some hot Nandoâs sauce, the bagel really was filling and packed with flavour! A tasty bagel, perfect for a quick lunch or post work bite. ð¥¯ð \n\nMixed slush - Wow! This slush is quite easily the best Iâve ever had! The combination of flavours worked so so well, and there was no hint of a strange after taste as there is with most slushes! The delicious flavours remained right through to the last drop, a rarity with slushes! ð¹ð¥\n\nOverall, I had a great experience @dabagelspot - the bagel and slush were brilliant, and the service was fantastic.  The other menu items look incredible and Iâm sure to be back when Iâm next In Shoreditch! An affordable and delicious spot for all to enjoy! ðð¼ð¥\n\n#dabagelspot #shoreditch #jerkchicken #slush #jamaicanfood",
